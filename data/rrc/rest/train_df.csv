"We had the lobster sandwich and it was FANTASTIC . My husband said he could 've eaten several more , the portion was fine for me he even exclaimed that the french fries were the best he has had .

We waited at the bar and had martinis that were just right . We will be back .",how is the lobster sandwich ?,FANTASTIC
"This small Astoria souvlaki spot makes what many consider the best gyros in New York . Small , bright , and clean , BZ Grill stands apart from the usual run of gyro joints , both in Astoria and out . What really makes it shine is the food , which is aggressively seasoned with Cyrpriot spices , and all made in-house ( even the gyro meat and sausages ) , and made of much higher quality ingredients that might otherwise be expected . All the various Greek and Cypriot dishes are excellent , but the gyro is the reason to come -- if you do n't eat one your trip was wasted .",how is the food ?,What really makes it shine

I love Indian food and consider myself to be quite an expert on it . Chennai Garden is my favorite Indian restaurant in the city . They have authentic Indian at amazin prices .

It 's a rather cramped and busy restaurant and it closes early .,Is this place vegan ?,VEGETARIAN

"This is some really good , inexpensive sushi . It costs $ 2 extra to turn a regular roll into an inside-out roll , but the roll more than triples in size , and that 's not just from the rice . The spicy Tuna roll is huge and probably the best that I 've had at this price range . The Yellowtail was particularly good as well . I have reservations about the all you can eat deal , however -- the choices are fairly limited and you can probably order more food than you can eat for less than $ 18 by just going off the menu .

"Possibly the Most Romantic Restaurant in the City This is undoubtedly my favorite modern Japanese brasserie ( that don ’ t serve sushi ) , and in my opinion , one of the most romantic restaurants in the city ! Not only is it an adventure getting to this somewhat hidden spot , once you enter the unmarked wooden doors , the zen and intimate décor will make you feel like you ’ re no longer in the city . If you ’ re planning to come here , make sure that your date is someone whom you really like since you ’ ll be ushered to private booths where there will be no people or food watching ( choose the ones on the ground level that have glass ceilings so you may see the stars in the sky ! ) . It ’ s just you and your date and an occasional cute ‘ excuse me ’ before the waiter opens the little curtain to your booth ! My party had the BBE $ 29 fixe prix menu , which was such a wonderful deal since it also came with a flight of sake ! I never used to be a fan of sakes but am lately experimenting with it a lot more and am acquiring a better taste of it . We started off with a delightful sashimi amuse bouche . Our first course was Tuna Sashimi with Green Yuzu Sauce . I picked the Grilled Black Cod as my entree , which I absolutely devoured while someone commented that the Grilled Salmon dish was better . The entrees were served with miso soup and rice . The sake ’ s complimented the courses very well and is successfully easing me into the sake world . For desserts , we tried the frozen black sesame mousse ( interesting but not extraordinary ) and matcha ( powdered green tea ) and blueberry cheesecake , which was phenomenal . Maybe it was the great company ( I had friends visiting from Philly – yes , it was not a date this time ) or the super reasonable price point , but I just can ’ t say enough good things about this brasserie . I don ’ t usually visit the same establishment more than once , what more twice , but I ’ ll come to Zenkichi anytime for a quiet , unhurried and memorable dinner .",do they have tuna ?,Tuna Sashimi with Green Yuzu Sauce

"I have been to Roth 's twice and both times were very disappointing . Once for dinner and once for brunch . Both times I was extremely dissappointed by the service , which was boarderline rude . They wouldnt even let me finish my glass of wine before offering another . Much of the time it seems like they do not care about you . The dinner was ok , nothing I would have again .

"A restaurant that does n't try to do anything except serve great food with great service in a pleasant atmosphere . No gimmicks here -- the food speaks for itself in its freshness and preparation . The dining room is quietly elegant with no music to shout over -- how refreshing ! The service was impeccable and unobtrusive -- the staff knows what they are there to do -- to know their menu , present your meal , and attend to your needs . Looking around , I saw a room full of New Yorkers enjoying a real meal in a real restaurant , not a clubhouse of the fabulous trying to be seen . Beautiful experience .",is the food freshly made ?,food speaks for itself

"Great Indian food I lived on 50th st , and wanted Indian one day so decided to check this place out . Food was amazing - I love Indian food and eat it quite regularly , but I can say this is one of the best I 've had . Very "" normal Indian food "" , but done really well . I have it a 4 instead of 5 because of the price ( just chicken tikka masala - no bread of rice - is $ 25 ) , which I would expect at a upscale Indian restaurant but this place does n't have an upscale feel . Also , waiters try to push more food on you , like suggest things as if they are complimentary when they actually cost $ . I do n't appreciate places or people that try to drive up the bill without the patron 's knowledge so that was a huge turnoff ( more than the price ) . But if you 're prepared to spend some $ and remember to ask if something they offer is complimentary , then this is the place to go for Indian food",how much for the chicken tikka masala ?,no bread of rice - is $ 25

"What a hassle ! The food is very good , but not outstanding . There is no way it justifies the accolades it receives , the attitude of the staff or the wait for a table . On our last visit , they skipped over our name on the list , leaving us waiting an extra hour for a table . Mistakes happen , but they are usually accompanied by an apology , perhaps even a glass of wine ... but not the grunt that we received from the Al Di La staff . Without the wait or attitude , I would probably go back , but there are just too many other restaurants in Brooklyn that are as good or better and do n't make me jump through hoops .",how is the food ?,"very good , but not outstanding"

Without the wait or attitude , I would probably go back , but there are just too many other restaurants in Brooklyn that are as good or better and do n't make me jump through hoops .",will you come back again ?,would probably

"Anybody who likes this place must be from a different planet , where greasy , dry and tasteless are complimentary . The dosas are skimpy , unattractive and drip with grease , and personally I 'd drink popcorn topping before I 'd eat another one of these . The sandwiches are dry , tasteless and way overpriced . Calling the place Hampton Chutney Co. does warn you that these folks offer more style than substance , but in this unattractive room with unhelpful clerks there was a dearth of the former too .",how are their sandwiches ?,"dry , tasteless and way overpriced"

"Single Worst Restaurant in Manhattan I 'll being with a couple of positives : cool decor , good pita and hummus , and grilled octopus that was actually pretty tasty . Moving on . If I could give 0 stars I would do so for this place . Casa La Femme is to middle eastern dining what Chuckie Cheeze is to italian . The reason there are 4 different results on citysearch for the same place is because they keep trying to start a new thread so they can stock it with positive reviews . Well ... they can run but they ca n't hide . I live in the West Village and I 've been to a lot of restaurants . Sometimes you pay a lot and do n't get much in return - it 's manhattan , things are expensive . However , most of them are at least prompt and pleasant . This place ... god where do i begin . It is quite a spectacular scene i 'll give them that . The decor however seems to be the distraction so you wo n't notice that you just payed 300 bucks for some cold eggplant that took 2 FRICKIN HOURS TO COME ! ! ! ! How this place survives the competitive west village market in this economy , or any other for that matter , is beyond me .",do you like their grilled octopus ?,pretty tasty

"Volare virgins or weekly regulars , everyone gets treated the same and you ca n't ask for more than that when the service is this friendly . The restaurant has a Family feel , not least with regard to the portions which are enormous ; the veal alone could have single-handedly solved third world famine . The anti-pasta was excellent , especially the calamari , as were the filling pasta mains . The wine list is extensive and can easily hike up an otherwise reasonably priced meal .

The restaurant has a Family feel , not least with regard to the portions which are enormous ; the veal alone could have single-handedly solved third world famine . The anti-pasta was excellent , especially the calamari , as were the filling pasta mains . The wine list is extensive and can easily hike up an otherwise reasonably priced meal .

"I tend to judge a sushi restaurant by its sea urchin , which was heavenly at sushi rose . It melted in my little mouth and the perfect consistency-not too fishy , creamy , and slightly buttery . The sushi seemed pretty fresh and was adequately proportioned . The rice to fish ration was also good -- they did n't try to overpack the rice . We took advanatage of the half price sushi deal on saturday so it was well worth it .",is the sushi fresh there ?,pretty fresh

"How is this palce still open ? I honestly do n't even know where to begin . My boyfriend and I are avid restaurant goers , and we are always on the lookout for new places and our friend had recommended Flatbush Farms . We arrived and were seated immediately , which made us both happy . We ordered our appetizers , I ordered the chicken and my boyfriend the salmon . Everything was going good until we got our meals . I took one look at the chicken and I was appalled . It was served with skin , over a bed of extremely undercooked spinach and mashed potatoes . My boyfriend asked me if I wanted to switch and eat his salmon instead , while he de-skinned the chicken so that I could enjoy the white meat . I took one bite from the $ 24 salmon , and I have never , in the 17 years I have been going to restaurants tasted salmon as fishy , as dry , and as bland as the one in Flatbush Farms . At this point , the waitress comes over and asks us if everything was okay , I was literally so shocked that I was speechless and did n't say anything , and guess what , the waitress WALKED away . So , I switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe I could stomach the meat and spinach again , but the spinach was so undercooked that I just could not bite through it . I could n't even enjoy the mashed potatoes because it was hidden completely under the chicken and spinach . I 've had better chicken at BBQs ! ! ! ! So I decide to report back to the waitress because it was completely inedible . Guess what , I waited for TWENTY minutes before she came over and when she finally did , she says , "" oh well , I wish you would have said something earlier "" No apology , nothing . After that she simply took our plates , walked away , came back another TWENTY minutes later with the bill and the chicken on it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! No desert menu , no apology , nothing ! ! ! ! ! ! I was literally going to explode , but instead , my boyfriend took the bill and went to find the manager . This is where it really really gets bad : the manager said , there is absolutely nothing we can do , it 's a matter of taste that she did n't like it , and I can not comp it . Again , no apology , no is there anything else I can get you , no can I get you a drink to make up for it , nothing ! ! ! ! We refused to pay for it because at this point it had nothing to do with the food anymore . The level of rudeness was preposterous . The manager came to the table and said we can do what we want , so we paid for what we did enjoy , the drinks and appetizers , and walked out . I HAVE NEVER EVER HAD SUCH AN UNPLEASANT EXPERIENCE . THIS STAFF SHOULD BE FIRED .",how much for the salmon ?,$ 24

Right off the L in Brooklyn this is a nice cozy place with good pizza . Mine was a little burnt but still delicious with goat cheese and panchetta ( raddichio was kind of bitter though ) .

Kind of a small place but I guess if they are not too busy might be able to fit a group or kids . Overall I would recommend it and go back again .

"This place would be so much better served by being run by a group that actually understands customer service . The only thing you can do here is walk in and eat .. but planning an event , especially a small , intimate one , forget about it . They are not helpful in the least and will give you the grand run around so by the time the event date rolls around you will not only regret chosing this place , but also become hostile ! Nobody at this restaurant will give firm answers about anything and in the end , not one person takes responsibility for anything . Terrible , terrible management - deserves to be shut-down .",how is their management ?,"Terrible , terrible"

The food is delicious - from the specials to the regular menu-fare , the dishes are never a disappointment .

Although the tables may be closely situated , the candle-light , food-quality and service overcompensate . A guaranteeed delight !",how is the lamb glazed with balsamic vinegar ?,never a disappointment

"More Williamsburg Garbage My wife and I visited Dokebi tonight . We ordered dosut bibimbap and nakgi-bokum . The dishes came out around 5 minutes apart . The bibimbap was average , but the stone bowl was n't even close to sizzling . Too bad I had paid an extra $ 2 for the stone bowl . The nakgi-bokum was horrible . Easily the worst stir-fried squid I 've ever tasted . The sauce tasted more like Chinese fast food than decent Korean . The side dishes were passable , and I did get a refill upon request . The real problem I had with this place was the complete lack of service . I mentioned the squid dish was n't very good when the waitress visited . She just nodded and walked off . There were no communications issues either , as she spoke perfect English . As to my comment about the food , no apology or acknowledgment was made . My wife had barely touched that mess of a dish . We were charged full price . If you ware looking for Korean fusion , I suggest you try some of the places in the East Village . Authentic Korean food lovers should visit 32nd Street , of course .",how much to have a stone bowl there ?,$ 2

We never ate because by close to 2 in the monring we were not served and were too upset ad tired to start eating .

"Dumbfoundingly Poor This was , from start to finish , a mind-bogglingly uncomfortable experience . Lexicographers take note : a new and fascinating definition of rudeness is alive and flourishing right here in Brooklyn . The servers at Flatbush Farm appear to have perfected that ghastly technique of making you feel guilty and ashamed for deigning to attract their attention . Polite acknowledgement is out ; supercilious scorn is in . And how many times can you pick up the same perfectly aligned set of napkins , inspect them vapidly and plonk them down in exactly the same place instead of venturing a glance at people who are there to help you make the rent ? A different server enhanced the fun , dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our appetizer ( which was delicious ) . Overall the food quality was pretty good , though I hear the salmon is much better when it has n't sat cooling in front of the guest . The place has a nice fit-out , some attractive furnishings and , from what I could tell , a reasonable wine list ( I was given the food menu when I asked for the carte des vins ) At $ 120 for two people , however , this in no way represents value , unless you 're looking to pay by the hour for passive-aggressive torture . On that scale , it 's a world-beater .",how is the food quality overall ?,pretty good

And $ 11 for a plate of bland guacamole ? Come on . Do n't get me started on the margaritas , either . Mine tasted like the bartender had forgotten to add the tequila . Really , I find it rather scandalous that such a crappy restaurant attracts such crowds -- this , in the city of a million restaurants , at least 9/10 of which are way better than this one . Save your money and your time and go somewhere else . Oh , and I never write reviews -- I just was so moved by how bad this place was , I felt it was my duty to spread the word .",how much for the bland guacamole ?,$ 11

The service was terrible , we had to wait for everything and ask several of different people for the same thing before we were allowed to be served . The waitress , seems to be more concerned of looking good than actually waitressing . After dinner the manager grabbed my boyfriend , asked him : Where are you from ... maybe you dont know how things work in America ... and in the end stormed away almost teareyed yelling that tips are the only thing they survive on . We did tip , I guess the model/waitress just wanted more and complained to the manager .

"Poor service and management Don ’ t go to this place ! Had an awful experience at Casa la Femme on a Saturday dinner . Appetizers took nearly an hour . When the main course finally arrived ( another 45mins ) half of our order was missing . Never got an explanation as to what was going on . The manager was rude and handled the situation extremely poorly . When we threatened to leave , we were offered a meager discount even though half the order was missing . On the way out , we heard of other guests complaining about similar issues . Can ’ t believe how an expensive NYC restaurant can be so disrespectful to its clients .",do you like their service ?,Poor

"First of all , this place is *not* romantic , as claimed by Citysearch 's editorial review . Either that , or the editor 's idea of romance must be sharing a conversation with the next table , while trying to speak louder than the traffic on 57th . The tables are crammed way too close , the menu is typical of any Italian restaurant , and the wine list is simply overpriced . Slightly above average wines start at $ 70+ with only one selection listed at $ 30+ . Service is not what one would expect from a joint in this price category . For instance , plates were just dumped on the table , I was handed the wine list upside down , etc ... . Somehow working the italian charm with constant mille grazie does not constitute proper service . To be completely fair , the only redeeming factor was the food , which was above average , but could n't make up for all the other deficiencies of Teodora .",how is the wine ?,simply overpriced

"Terrible Waste of money.. scammers I agree that dining at Casa La Femme is like no other dining experience ! BUT not in a good way . I am actually offended to have spent so much money on such a bad experience . I literally just got back home after visiting Casa La Femme and was so offended by my visit felt it necessary to try and warn other diners who value their money and time . We went to celebrate two birthdays and wanted to do something special and different . Our visit their to say the least , was an unpleasant and costly experience ! And even more so unpleasant because it was so costly for such an unpleasant experience . We did arrive late for our reservation so I can not complain too much about the wait for a table . Although we were told 10-15 minutes and it was more like 45 minutes . We were ushered to the bar to wait momentarily and upon arrival were so excited . The place is beautiful ! The hostess was very pleasant . However , our $ 14 drinks were were horrible ! Once we finally got a table , despite indicating we wanted an alla carte menu we were pushed into a table that was only price fixed ! Since we were already waiting so long , we felt we had no other choice but to accept it . Our experience did not ever get any better . For each course we waited over 1/2 hour to 45 minutes and were never offered a drink . We also asked for Hooka six times and the waiter kept telling us one minute and never returning with the Hooka . After the 4th time i asked again and the waiter than said after our dinner . We asked for beverages and never received them . We asked for sides which the waiter than admitted that he forgot to put in that part of our order . My chicken was inedible as there were so many fatty lumps which i had to keep spitting out into my napkin . I would not expect this for a $ 55 dinner . By the time we finished our dinner we still had not received one beverage NOR hooka ! What we did do was waste 3 hours being trapped in a table waiting and waiting for food and drinks and hooka.. some of which we never received ! The only beverage we did receive was water in dirty glasses ! To top it all off.. the main reason we came to your restaurant was for the belly dancers and missed the first show as we were not seated yet and the 2nd belly dancer only danced at two tables in the back of the restaurant and never made it around to the other half of the restaurant . By the time we left our wallets were empy and so were our stomachs AND we missed the show we were supposed to see following our dinner , which would have been acceptable if we got to enjoy the experience of good food and belly dancers ! If it seemed possible to do so while there I would have fought my bill since my dinner portion of my meal was inedible ! I have never left a restaurant feeling as if i was abused , and wasted my hard earned money . MY husbands birthday and my sons was not as it was intended ... and we drove two hours to spend too much money to be treated terribly ! I wish I COULD be refunded !",anything wrong with the chicken ?,inedible as there were so many fatty lumps which i had to keep spitting out into my napkin

Try the congee and the donut like deep fried dough they call Ow Ley Soh , a delicious and sweet tasting bread . Simply some good tasting Chinese food at incredible prices ... Service is not what you are coming here for ... Just make sure my ice water is kept full and my tea kettle filled with piping hot tea and that 's all the service I need ... Big Wong is a great place to eat and fill your stomach .",what 's the style of their food ?,Chinese
Great sushi experience . Nice value . Unique apppetizers . Try sushimi cucumber roll .,how is the sushi ?,Great
"We ate outside at Haru 's Sake bar because Haru 's restaurant next door was overflowing . What 's the difference between the two ? Their sake list was extensive , but we were looking for Purple Haze , which was n't listed but made for us upon request ! The spicy tuna roll was unusually good and the rock shrimp tempura was awesome , great appetizer to share ! We went around 9:30 on a Friday and it had died down a bit by then so the service was great !",how is their sake list ?,extensive

"I have eaten at Saul , many times , the food is always consistently , outrageously good . Saul is the best restaurant on Smith Street and in Brooklyn . The duck confit is always amazing and the foie gras terrine with figs was out of this world . The wine list is interesting and has many good values . For the price , you can not eat this well in Manhattan .",how is the food there ?,"always consistently , outrageously good"
